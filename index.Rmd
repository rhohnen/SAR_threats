## Calculate the number of columns in common between caribou and other species

How many columns overlap?
```{r common_columns, echo=TRUE}
####look at the number of column in common between caribou and all other species in the dataset

library(dplyr)
# First, extract the row corresponding to "caribou"
caribou_row <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>% 
  filter(common_name == "caribou boreal population") %>%
  select(-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,70,71,72,73,74,75,76))  # Remove the Species column (if present)

# Create dataset to compare with
species_all_row <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>%
  select(c(15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,
            41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,
            67,68,69))

# Create a new dataset comparing "caribou" to all other rows (and count 1's)
comparison <- species_all_row %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(matching_ones = sum(caribou_row == 1 & c_across(everything()) == 1, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Add common_columns column (!) to overlap_caribou_threats single
matching_ones <- comparison$matching_ones
overlap_caribou_threats_single <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>%
  mutate(matching_ones = as.numeric(matching_ones))

# look at correlation between common_columns and jaccard
correlation_test <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>% select(3,6,12,70,72,73,75,76,77)

numeric_vars <- correlation_test%>%
  select(Percent_caribou, Total_area_km, Row42_sim, matching_ones)

correlation_matrix <- cor(numeric_vars, use = "complete.obs")  # Use complete.obs to handle NAs
correlation_matrix

```

## Check for correlations prior to running models

Compute correlations between variables that could be included in the models. None appear to have correlation coefficients greater than 0.4.
```{r correlation, echo=TRUE}

# Change some columns to factors
#overlap_caribou_threats_single <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>%
  #mutate(
    #sara_status = as.factor(sara_status),
    #taxonomic_group = as.character(taxonomic_group))

model_subset <- overlap_caribou_threats_single %>% select(3,6,12,70,72,73,75,76)

#numeric_vars <- model_subset %>%
  #select(Percent_caribou, Total_area_km, sara_status, taxonomic_group) %>%
  #mutate(  sara_status = as.numeric(as.factor(sara_status)),  # Convert factors to numeric
  #taxonomic_group = as.numeric(as.factor(taxonomic_group))
 #)

correlation_matrix <- cor(numeric_vars, use = "complete.obs")  # Use complete.obs to handle NAs

# Print the correlation matrix
print(correlation_matrix)
```

## Model correlates of threat overlap with caribou

Run a glm that examine drivers of overlap in threats (Jaccard index) with caribou. These predictors include species range area (Total_area_km), percentage range overlap with caribou (Percent_caribou), taxonomic group (taxonomic_group_1 etc) and SARA status (sara_status1).
Quasibinomial model was chosen as the response variable (Jaccard index) goes from 0-1.

```{r model, echo=TRUE}

# Run some glms looking at descriptors of threat overlap with caribou

library(stats)
m2 <- glm(Row42_sim~Percent_caribou + Total_area_km + sara_status + taxonomic_group, data=model_subset,
          family=quasibinomial(link = "logit"))

summary(m2)
unique(overlap_caribou_threats_single$taxonomic_group)
```

Evidence of greater threat overlap with caribou for species with greater range sizes, more overlap in their range with caribou, and for mammals and birds.
```{r check fit, echo=TRUE}

# Check fit
null_dev <- summary(m2)$null.deviance
resid_dev <- summary(m2)$deviance

prop_deviance_explained <- (null_dev - resid_dev) / null_dev
prop_deviance_explained

# Residuals vs. Fitted values
plot(fitted(m2), residuals(m2), main = "Residuals vs. Fitted")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

# Normal Q-Q Plot of residuals
qqnorm(residuals(m2))
qqline(residuals(m2), col = "blue")

```

## Plot SAR taxonomic group and caribou range overlap

Make a graph that shows which taxonomic groups of SAR overlap most with caribou ranges
```{r overlap, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
overlap <- read.csv("SAR_cara_overlap.csv", header=TRUE,)

# Reshape data for grouped bar plot
library(tidyr)
overlap_long <- overlap %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(SAR, SAR_caribou_range, SAR_caribou_range_20),
               names_to = "Metric", 
               values_to = "Value")

# Create grouped bar plot
ggplot(overlap_long, aes(x = Group, y = Value, fill = Metric)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Taxonomic group",
       y = "Number of species",
       fill = "Metric") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkseagreen2", "khaki1", "green4"),
                    labels = c("SAR", "SAR that overlap with caribou", "SAR that overlap with caribou >20%")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = 'darkgrey'),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'white'),
    text = element_text(size = 16),  # Increase overall font size
    axis.title = element_text(size = 18),  # Axis titles
    axis.text = element_text(size = 16),  # Axis text
  )

```
